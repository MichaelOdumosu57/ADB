Connect to a device over Wi-Fi

  1. Connect your Android device and adb host computer to a common Wi-Fi network accessible to both.
   Beware that not all access points are suitable; you might need to use an access point whose firewall
   is configured properly to support adb

  2. If you are connecting to an Wear OS device, turn off Bluetooth on the phone that's paired with the device

  3. Connect the device to the host computer with a USB cable

  4. Set the target device to listen for a TCP/IP connection on port 5555
      adb tcpip 5555

  5. Disconnect the USB cable from the target device
