adb checks if a server process is running if not then it starts one
all adb clients use port 5037 for adb server
the server sets up connections to all running devices  and they use pairs, even ports for console and odd for 3adb
you can control your computer from a phone and likewise
when you connect a device greater than android ver 4.2.2 it ask for RSA for security
Whats an emulator


Connect to a device over Wi-Fi

  1. Connect your Android device and adb host computer to a common Wi-Fi network accessible to both.
   Beware that not all access points are suitable; you might need to use an access point whose firewall
   is configured properly to support adb

  2. If you are connecting to an Wear OS device, turn off Bluetooth on the phone that's paired with the device

  3. Connect the device to the host computer with a USB cable

  4. Set the target device to listen for a TCP/IP connection on port 5555
      adb tcpip 5555

  5. Disconnect the USB cable from the target device

  6.Find the IP address of the Android device.

  7. Connect to the device by its IP address.
          adb connect [device_ip_address]
          adb connect 192.168.1.8

  8.Confirm that your host computer is connected to the target device:
  adb devices
    List of devices attached
    [device_ip_address] :5555 device

  9. the adb connection is ever lost: or refuses to connect
      turn off usb debugging then turn it back on again
      or restart things till something works



Query for devices

          important to know what device is connected to the adb server
          adb devices -l
              Serial number: A string created by adb to uniquely identify the device by its port number.
                  ex: emulator-5554
              State: The connection state
                  offine: connected to the computer but not the servers
                  device: watch the device may not be fully booted
                  no device: there is no device connected


      Emulator not listed
          adb devices has a corner case command where you cannot see emulators this happens when
          the adb server is not running and
          you use the emulator commannd with the -port || ports oprtion with an odd-numbered port between 5554 5584 and
          you start the server after starting the emulator  and
          the odd port chosen is not busy so the port Connection is made or the port is busy so it chooses an even port

        to avoid This
          let the emulator choose its own ports
          dont run more than 16 emulators
          start the adb server beforehand

Example 1:
here the adb device command starts the server but no devices are found
for avd proivde a valid one from your system by using emulator -list-avds
emulator command is in the android_sdk/tools directory




      $ adb kill-server
      $ emulator -avd [Nexus_6_API_25] -port 5555
      $ adb devices

      List of devices attached
      * daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *
      * daemon started successfully *


        Example 2

        $ adb kill-server
        $ emulator -avd Nexus_6_API_25 -port 5557
        $ adb start-server
        $ adb devices

        List of devices attached
        emulator-5557 device


Send commands to a specific device

  to choose a specific device


  $ adb devices
  List of devices attached
  emulator-5554 device
  emulator-5555 device

  $ adb -s emulator-5555 install helloWorld.apk


  if there are multiple targets but you do not specify adb generates an error

Install an app


    adb install path_to_apk
    to test use the -t flag

Set up port forwarding

    sets up forwarding of host port 6100 to device port 7100:
    adb forward tcp:6100 tcp:7100

    adb forward tcp:6100 local:logd


Copy files to/from a device

    To copy a file or directory and its sub-directories from the device, do the following:
      adb pull remote local

    To copy a file or directory and its sub-directories to the device, do the following:
      adb push local remote


Stop the adb server

    sometimes you might need to do this when adb does not respond to a command

adb commands reference

      adb [-d | -e | -s serial_number] command


      -s: Install the app on the SD card.
      -d: Allow version code downgrade (debugging packages only).
      -g: Grant all runtime permissions.


Global options	                    Description
-a	                                Listen on all network interfaces instead of only on localhost.

-d	                                Direct an adb command to the only attached USB device.
                                    Returns an error when more than one USB device is attached.

-e	                                Direct an adb command to the only running emulator.
                                    Returns an error when more than one emulator is running.

-s                                  serial_number	Direct an adb command to a specific device,
                                    referred to by its adb-assigned serial number (such as emulator-5556).
                                    Overrides the serial number value stored in the $ANDROID_SERIAL environment variable.
                                    See Send Commands to a Specific Device.

-H [server]	                        The name of the adb server host. The default value is localhost.

-P [port]	                          The adb server port number. The default value is 5037.

-L [socket]                        	Listen on the provided adb server socket. The default value is tcp:localhost:5037.
